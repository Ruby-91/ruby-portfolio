      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’m an engineering professional transitioning into Product Management with hands-on experience in building AI-driven, agentic workflows and automation systems. At Accenture and Infosys, I led and supported end-to-end delivery, stakeholder collaboration, and standardization efforts across 12+ locations.

      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
        Currently, at San José State University (MS, Engineering Management, GPA 3.9), I’ve focused on customer experience optimization, data-driven decision-making, and operations planning. I enjoy turning business problems into working MVPs using tools like Google Apps Script, n8n, Airtable, and React.

      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        I’m actively looking for Product, Project, or Program Management roles where I can combine technical depth with structured execution.
