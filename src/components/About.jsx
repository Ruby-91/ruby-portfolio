      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I'm <strong>Ruby Gupta</strong>, a results-driven professional with over
        six years of experience in <strong>software development, analytics, and product execution</strong>.
        Currently pursuing my <strong>MS in Engineering Management</strong> at
        San José State University (GPA 3.9), I combine my technical expertise
        with business and management acumen to deliver impactful, data-driven
        solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Before transitioning into management and product-focused roles, I worked
        at <strong>Infosys</strong> and <strong>Accenture</strong>, where I led
        cross-functional teams to integrate systems for global clients like
        Google Flights and AB InBev. These experiences strengthened my
        foundations in <strong>software development, SDLC, stakeholder collaboration</strong>,
        and <strong>end-to-end delivery</strong> across fast-paced enterprise
        environments.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’m passionate about using <strong>AI and automation</strong> to simplify
        decision-making and improve operational efficiency. My recent projects —
        including the <em>AI Weekly Update Agent (TrendLens)</em>,
        <em> Canvas Deadline Nudge Assistant</em>, and a
        <em> Product Feedback Dashboard</em> — reflect my focus on
        <strong>integrating machine learning, automation, and user insights</strong>
        into scalable product solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        With a strong foundation in
        <strong> data analysis, process improvement, and AI-assisted workflows</strong>,
        I thrive at the intersection of technology, business strategy, and
        execution. My goal is to drive innovation as a
        <strong> Product or Program Manager</strong> by building intelligent,
        user-centric systems that deliver measurable impact.
